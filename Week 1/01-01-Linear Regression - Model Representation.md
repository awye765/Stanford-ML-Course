# Week 01-01 Linear Regression: Model Representation

## Model Representation

### Notation

- m = number of training examples
- x = input variable / feature
- y = output variable / "target" feature
- x<sup>(i)</sup> = the 'i'th x variable
- y<sup>(i)</sup> = the 'i'th y variable
- h = hypothesis, which is a function that takes an input (x), performs a function to provide an output (y).  
- Î¸ = the weights assigned to a particular feature.  Also known as coefficients (i.e. the numerical or constant quantity placed before and multiplying the variable in an algebraic function).
