# Week 00-00 Machine Learning - Teaching Myself

## Objectives

To learn how to <b>understand</b> and <b>apply</b> key machine learning techniques to answer these big questions:

1. <b>What</b> are the main machine learning techniques?

2. <b>How</b> do the main machine learning techniques work?

3. <b>When</b> to use one technique vs. another and <b>why</b>?

4. How the above applies to my company's work using machine learning to understand text within contracts.

## Learning Approach

1. Work through Andrew Ng Stanford University Machine Learning Course via Coursera to understand the theory behind key algorithms and techniques.

2. For each topic in Andrew Ng's course, refactor notes against Google Machine Learning Crash Course sections on equivalent topics.

3. Attempt at least x 1 - 2 practical examples (e.g. using Python + libraries if necessary) to embed practical application and understanding of each topic.  

4. Practical examples to derive from Andrew Ng course, Google course, FastAI course or applicable tutorials found elsewhere online (e.g. Medium)
