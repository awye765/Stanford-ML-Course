    "#### Confusion 2 - numpy.matrix (features as columns) vs. Andrew Ng Sample Vector (features as rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "In various python implementations of the coding exercises, including the one I've adapted, numpy matrices are often used to organise the input variables $x$ and the $\\theta$ values.  However, it took me some time to appreciate that used this way, numpy matrices organise features as columns and samples as rows vs. the Andrew Ng course's orientation, i.e. samplees as columns and features as rows.  For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a numpy.matrix of the X values like so: `X = np.matrix(X.values)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Doing so organises the samples into rows and features into columns like so: `X[1]` returns `matrix([[1.    , 2104    , 5    , 1    , 45]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The same applies if the $\\theta$ values are organised in a numpy matrix, e.g. `matrix([[1.    , 2    , 3    , 4    , 5]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "This caused confusion when jumping between my python implementations and Andrew Ng's course materials, including the MatLab/OCTAVE coding exercises.  The key difference being that if using numpy matrices per the above, it's necessary to <b>transpose</b> the $\\theta$ row vector into a column vector to ensure correct dimensionality and allow matrix multiplication."
